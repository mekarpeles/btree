Binary Tree Utility
===================

Simple binary tree utility to construct basic Binary Trees + perform
searches for nodes having a value closest to user defined values

Directions: 
~~~~~~~~~~~
python bs.py -h for help.

Flags:
~~~~~~
usage: bs.py [-h] [-i ITEMS] [-k NEAREST]

Builds a Binary Search Tree (BST) and finds the node containing the closest
value to some value k

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i ITEMS, --items ITEMS
                        An ordered csv of int items to insert into the binary
                        tree, e.g: -i 10,11,6,9,8,7
  -k NEAREST, --nearest NEAREST
                        Find the node containing the abs(value) closest to
                        that if value k

tests:
~~~~~~
To run test cases, from this diretory, cd into project directory
(btree) and type "nosetests" from the command line. Requires python
library 'nose'. To install nose with pip, type:
$ sudo pip install nose

# nosetests example:
$ nosetests
...
